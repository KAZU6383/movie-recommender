Laurence Olivier is that difficult fellow Mr. Darcy, whose mulishness about the Bennet girls begins to thaw when he gets a dose of Elizabeth's sense and sensibility.

Edmund Gwenn is lovely as Mr. Bennet, and Mary Boland brash as Mrs. Bennet; Garson, although MGM liked to corset her in fine-lady roles, manages to let Elizabeth's sauciness come through.

Teen Titans - The Complete First Season (DC Comics Kids Collection),"This 2-disc set collects the first 13 episodes of Teen Titans, which were also previously released on 2 single-disc editions.<br /><br />I like Teen Titans. It's a very different take on the DC characters than Batman, Superman, and Justice League, and there are obvious anime influences in the fight scenes and gags. What's nice about the series is that while it generally writes towards a younger audience, it's never so simplistic that it alienates the older crowd. The chemistry between the five leads is great, and there are occasional moments of lunacy that will make you wonder if the staff is secretly taking anything in the back room (ie the Mad Mod episode). Plus season 1's underlying subplot involving Slade (voiced expertly by Ron 'Hellboy' Perlman) is as dark and driven as anything in the Batman shows. The only time this show falls flat for me is when it puts stylized action over story essentials, which some of the early episodes here fall into.<br /><br />Again, this set collects material that WB has already released. I think even the bulk of the bonus features have been carried over. I'm hoping this was a sudden shift in WB's animation-on-dvd strategy as opposed to milking the consumer with re-releases, as the single discs were already quite generous in their own way.

Ballroom Dancing Mastery System: Beginner's Guide to Ballroom Dance,"When I accepted a review sample of this set I was more interested in learning how to better support dancers as a musician than how to dance. What surprised me was how I got drawn into the instruction and had I had a willing partner I would have explored these lessons as a dancer as well.<br /><br />Since others and the product description over the contents I am going to bypass that and give my own perspective through the lens of a musician.<br /><br />What I love is how thoroughly the instructors dissect each dance. You are shown each step and movement (and the dance itself) from the lead partners perspective, the following partner, and also with and without music. Moreover, the dances are discussed from the context of social and competitive dancing, and each is vastly different.<br /><br />The music used was my main interest. It is not strong dance music with a heavy beat, but orchestra fare with a more subtle groove (pulse would be a better word.)

Wilcox, who proceed to beat Bobby into confessing to the murder. Bobby is placed on trial, where Bobby's defense attorney McNair puts up a lousy defense for Bobby, and Bobby is sentenced to be executed. Now, eight years later, Bobby hands a letter to his grandmother Evangeline and asks Evangeline to go to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to hire Harvard law professor Paul Armstrong to clear Bobby's name. At Harvard, Paul is attacking capital punishment in a campus debate, when Evangeline arrives and hands the letter to Paul. Paul goes home, where his wife Laurie is throwing a birthday party for their young daughter Katey. Laurie reads the letter and she encourages Paul to take the case, even though he hasn't practiced law in 25 years. Paul, Laurie, and Katey head to Florida, where Paul meets Bobby in the prison. Bobby tells Paul his side of the story and what Tanny and Wilcox did. Paul begins to believe that Bobby was railroaded. Bobby tells Paul to speak to Blair Sullivan, a man who is also on death row. Blair gives Paul some clues that could prove Bobby's innocence,  and Blair's own guilt. But in the process of trying to clear Bobby, Paul learns some disturbing truths about Bobby, putting Paul and his family in a fight for their lives.

One Million Years B.C.,"This is a great old caveman movie I first saw in a theater as a teenager. If you enjoy this genre, you will probably enjoy this. The acting and Harryhausen's work in the production make it predictable but enjoyable. Note that the version I am reviewing (the R2 PAL import) is uncropped widescreen, but it is not an anamorphic transfer and is letterboxed, so it has huge black bars on the top, bottom and sides on any TV. The transfer is very good, with sharp images but the letterboxing wastes bitrate. If you use the zoom or similar control on your TV or player, the image quality degrades. It does have the interviews with Welch and Harryhausen that are apparently missing on the Region 1 NTSC disc, which sounds terrible (see the other reviews below). This is better, but far from the definitive version that its fans deserve. Since it is PAL, you will need a multistandard player to watch it on a TV in the US without converting it using software. It should play on most PCs with no conversion but will require changing the region code of your optical drive or a region-free driver (google 'Passkey').",4.6,1269.0,"{'thumb': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51n+KIYKNaL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg', 'large': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51n+KIYKNaL.jpg', 'variant': 'MAIN', 'hi_res': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1svVAr08vL._SL1500_.jpg'}",['dvd REGION 2'],this is a great old caveman movie i first saw in a theater as a teenager if you enjoy this genre you will probably enjoy this the acting and harryhausens work in the production make it predictable but enjoyable note that the version i am reviewing the r2 pal import is uncropped widescreen but it is not an anamorphic transfer and is letterboxed so it has huge black bars on the top bottom and sides on any tv the transfer is very good with sharp images but the letterboxing wastes bitrate if you use the zoom or similar control on your tv or player the image quality degrades it does have the interviews with welch and harryhausen that are apparently missing on the region 1 ntsc disc which sounds terrible see the other reviews below this is better but far from the definitive version that its fans deserve since it is pal you will need a multistandard player to watch it on a tv in the us without converting it using software it should play on most pcs with no conversion but will require changing the region code of your optical drive or a regionfree driver google passkey

Assuming the blame for the death of D.A. Harvey Dent, the Dark Knight sacrificed everything for what he and Commissioner Gordon both hoped was the greater good. For a time the lie worked, as criminal activity in Gotham City was crushed under the weight of the anti-crime Dent Act. But everything will change with the arrival of a cunning cat burglar with a mysterious agenda. Far more dangerous, however, is the emergence of Bane, a masked terrorist whose ruthless plans for Gotham drive Bruce out of his self-imposed exile. But even if he dons the cape and cowl again, Batman may be no match for Bane.', 'Review', 'Of all the ""most anticipated"" movies ever claiming that title, it\'s hard to imagine one that has caused so much speculation and breathless expectation as Christopher Nolan\'s final chapter to his magnificently brooding Batman trilogy,', 'The Dark Knight Rises', '. Though it may not rise to the level of the mythic grandeur of its predecessor,', 'The Dark Knight Rises', 'is a truly magnificent work of cinematic brilliance that commandingly completes the cycle and is as heavy with literary resonance as it is of-the-moment insight into the political and social affairs unfolding on the world stage. That it is also a full-blown and fully realized epic crime drama packed with state-of-the-art action relying equally on immaculate CGI fakery and heart-stopping practical effects and stunt work makes its entrée into blockbuster history worthy of all the anticipation and more. It deserves all the accolades it will get for bringing an opulently baroque view of a comic book universe to life with sinister effectiveness.', 'Set eight years after the events of', 'The Dark Knight', ',', 'TDK Rises', ""finds Bruce Wayne broken in spirit and body from his moral and physical battle with the Joker. Gotham City is at peace primarily because Batman took the fall for Harvey Dent's murder, allowing the former district attorney's memory to remain as a crime-fighting hero rather than the lunatic destructor he became as Two-Face. But that meant Batman's cape and cowl wound up in cold storage--perhaps for good--with only police commissioner Jim Gordon in possession of the truth. The threat that faces Gotham now is by no means new; as deployed by the intricate script that weaves themes first explored in"", 'Batman Begins', "", fundamental conflicts that predate his own origins are at the heart of the ultimate struggle that will leave Batman and his city either triumphant or in ashes. It is one of the movie's greatest achievements that we really don't know which way it will end up until its final exhilarating moments. Intricate may be an understatement in the construction of the script by Nolan and his brother Jonathan. The multilayered story includes a battle for control of Wayne Industries and the decimation of Bruce Wayne's personal wealth; a destructive yet potentially earth-saving clean energy source; a desolate prison colony on the other side of the globe; terrorist attacks against people, property, and the world's economic foundation; the redistribution of wealth to the 99 percent; and a virtuoso jewel thief who is identified in every way except name as Catwoman. Played with saucy fun and sexy danger by Anne Hathaway, Selina Kyle is sort of the catalyst (!) for all the plot threads, especially when she whispers into Bruce's ear at a charity ball some prescient words about a coming storm that will tear Gotham asunder. As unpredictable as it is sometimes hard to follow, the winds of this storm blow in a raft of diverse and extremely compelling new characters (including Selina Kyle) who are all part of a dance that ends with the ballet of a cataclysmic denouement. Among the new faces are Marion Cotillard as a green-energy advocate and Wayne Industries board member and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a devoted Gotham cop who may lead Nolan into a new comic book franchise. The hulking monster Bane, played by Tom Hardy with powerful confidence even under a clawlike mask, is so much more than a villain (and the toughest match yet for Batman's prowess). Though he ends up being less important to the movie's moral themes and can't really match Heath Ledger's maniacal turn as Joker, his mesmerizing swagger and presence as demonic force personified are an affecting counterpoint to the moral battle that rages within Batman himself. Christian Bale gives his most dynamic performance yet as the tortured hero, and Michael Caine (Alfred), Gary Oldman (Gordon), and Morgan Freeman (Lucius Fox) all return with more gravitas and emotional weight than ever before. Then there's the action. Punctuated by three or four magnificent set pieces,"", 'TDKR', ""deftly mixes the cinematic process of providing information with punches of pow throughout (an airplane-to-airplane kidnap/rescue, an institutional terrorist assault and subsequent chase, and the choreographed crippling of an entire city are the above-mentioned highlights). The added impact of the movie's extensive Imax footage ups the wow factor, all of it kinetically controlled by Nolan and his top lieutenants Wally Pfister (cinematography), Hans Zimmer (composer), Lee Smith (editor), and Nathan Crowley and Kevin Kavanaugh (production designers). The best recommendation"", 'TDKR', ""carries is that it does not leave one wanting for more. At 164 minutes, there's plenty of nonstop dramatic enthrallment for a single sitting.

WWE: Royal Rumble 2012 [Blu-ray],"WWE<br />ROYAL RUMBLE 2012<br /><br />There were some interesting storylines going into this Rumble and even if there wasn't I would have been all about it. You see this is my favorite event since I love the actual Rumble match, plus I have always loved battle royals of any kind. I even loved WCW's ""World War 3"" event. Any way I like this event over all, not as good as others but not the worst.<br /><br />1.[WORLD TITLE TRIPLE THREAT STEEL CAGE MATCH]DANIEL BRYAN VS MARK HENRY VS BIG SHOW-I was honestly surprised that this match opened up the show. But the more I think about it I just realize they do not treat this title with the respect it deserves. Any way I really enjoyed this opening match as the story between the three was fun. Show and Henry displayed their power throughout the match as Bryan worked on chopping the bigger men down. The smashing up against the cage and such were excellent and Bryan trying to sneak out only to be caught was great. Still in the end Bryan defies the odds and keeps his belt.<br /><br />2.NATALYA, BETH PHOENIX, THE BELLA TWINS VS EVE TORRES, KELLY KELLY, TAMINA, ALICIA FOX-another match in which they team all the divas together just to get them on the card somehow. The match itself is pretty good compared to others but to be honest it is always Beth and Natalya that keep me interested here. There is some good action here like the diving onto everyone outside moment but it is Beth that ends it and ends it quick.<br /><br />3.JOHN CENA VS KANE-I was really wishing that a few certain things were going to play out with this storyline. First I wanted Kane to continue to be a destructive killer ever since he came back, I loved that he was back in the mask. Secondly I was kinda hoping that Cena would go heel because of this feud and embrace the hate. Based on the storyline with Zach I liked that this match was more of a brawl, it made sense. Kane was very dominating in this match controlling most of it laying into Cena with power moves and fists. Still Cena stayed in the game even delivering a top rope 5 knuckle shuffle. The match eventually spills onto the outside in which both men get counted out. This is a fight so they don't care as the fight all the way backstage leading to Kane finding Zach Ryder and destroying him as usual. Cena makes one last attempt at helping his friend but is chokeslammed by Kane for his troubles.<br /><br />4.BRODUS CLAY VS DREW MCINTYRE-I am still disappointed that Drew was put on this long loosing steak because this dude could be big in my opinion. I have been enjoying Clay and the funk like I enjoyed Flash with his Funk [who else remembers?] so this was fun for what it was. This was a squash match to help put over the funk, a really quick one, poor Drew.<br /><br />5.[WWE TITLE]CM PUNK VS DOLPH ZIGGLER-John Laurinaitis was the special referee for this match and man do I miss him as the GM. I can't help it I thought he was great in the role, of course we would come to find out that he made himself the special enforcer and not ref before the match. This of course was because Triple H was coming to Raw the next night to evaluate him. Any way two of my favorite wrestlers would go at it here so I knew this would be a good match. Before the match starts John sends Vickie to the back which was kinda upsetting because I love her as a heel manager. Any way just as I thought this was the best match on the card as both men go all out. This is a back and forth match with highlights throughout like Punk catching a little whiplash. I liked how this match played out including Johnny helping with the three count to see Punk keep his title. Loved the Randy Savage chants.<br /><br />6.ROYAL RUMBLE-now of course the thing everyone looks forward to when this event comes around, the rumble match itself. Like always the Rumble was fun like it always should be but it didn't feel as epic as it should. Still I did enjoy it like the Socko/cobra showdown and Kofi Kingston displaying the best save from being eliminated since Morrison. There are some good eliminations, the announcers get involved, and Kharma comes back, over all it was a fun time. I really loved Road Dogg Jesse James coming back and showing that he still has it.<br /><br />Special features include interviews from the event and of course moments and matches from Raw and Smackdown.<br /><br />BONUS MATCHES<br /><br />1.CM PUNK, JOHN CENA VS DOLPH ZIGGLER, JACK SWAGGER-this was a match from the Raw before the Rumble. This was actually a pretty good match from Raw and it was cool to get this as a bonus since I like all of these guys. The pace is great and moves along nicely but the story here is Ziggler getting another pinfall over Punk.<br /><br />2.KANE VS ZACH RYDER-this was the match on Raw that would see Kane demolish Ryder and put him in a wheel chair. Kane dominates the match with Ryder trying come back every once in a while. In the end Kane would chokeslam Ryder threw the stage and then set his sights on Eve. She is saved when Cena makes his way out.<br /><br />3.ALEX RILEY VS BRODUS CLAY-this like many of Clay's matches is a squash match meant to get him over. It's cool I guess since you get to look at the girls but Riley was run over in this match.<br /><br />4.BIG SHOW VS MARK HENRY-this match is another short one from Smackdown that helped push the storyline with Bryan. He comes out of course which is why the match is so short but it was entertaining to say the least.<br /><br />This is a great Blu-Ray set that features some other moments from the Raw & Smackdown before the PPV. Also included are some interviews from the actual event and such so this is a good buy. I would highly recommend this Blu-Ray if you are a fan of the WWE.",4.6,125.0,"{'thumb': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51iPLbuGbnL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg', 'large': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51iPLbuGbnL.jpg', 'variant': 'MAIN', 'hi_res': None}","[""It's the dream of every superstar--to headline WrestleMania.

SLINGS & ARROWS: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION,"Unbelievably good. I sift through so many made-for-television projects with so much promise, then compromise my expectations so that I can walk away with at least one good thing to say about them. Then something like this comes along and I am astonished. With Shakespeare for a backbone, amazingly good writers, a superb ensemble of actors, and an encyclopedic knowledge of the history of effective drama, they've produced a stunning three-year, six episodes per year project. The length is just. The story telling is excellent. And--a measure of truly good comedy--each of the two times I've wated the entire set from beginning to end (burried in weekend snowstorms in New England)--I've cried at the end of each year's production--and by God, I am not a weepy man. I bought this because I'm a complete slave to Shakespeare in any form, but that hook was quickly overwhelmed by the overall excellence of each episode. And I've been left wanting more. It's just so ingenius. The last time I was this happy with a TV series was with Northern Exposure, and it's American excellence hovers at least ten points (out of 100) below this Canadian masterpiece. 'Nuf said.

Gremlins (Special Edition),"I saw this movie when it was in the theaters, but I had not remembered just how funny it was until I got the DVD. I was laughing so hard at the bar-room scene I couldn't catch my breath!<br /><br />A rather incompetent inventor goes into a curiosity shop in Chinatown looking for a Christmas gift for his teenage son. He comes across an odd little creature, as adorable as a teddy bear, called a Mogwai. He wants to buy it, but the old man who runs the shop says it's not for sale. The old man's grandson, however, says they need the money, and he brings it out to sell in the alley. Along with the Mogwai comes three rules for taking care of him: (1) he does not like bright lights; (2) don't get him wet, and (3) most important, never, ever feed him after midnight.<br /><br />Of course, all three rules are eventually broken, and the results are scaly green gremlins that run riot all over town. As I say, the bar-room scene is quite hilarious. A large group of them are cornered in the movie theater (where some more great visual jokes are done), but Stripe, the leader of the gang, gets into the department store across the street.<br /><br />The cute little Mogwai, named Gizmo, eventually triumphs, but how he does is the funniest movie you'll see in many a year.",4.7,20297.0,"{'thumb': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41+YjoHwEWL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg', 'large': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41+YjoHwEWL.jpg', 'variant': 'MAIN', 'hi_res': None}","['Gremlins: Special Edition (DVD)', ']]>']",i saw this movie when it was in the theaters but i had not remembered just how funny it was until i got the dvd i was laughing so hard at the barroom scene i couldnt catch my breathbr br a rather incompetent inventor goes into a curiosity shop in chinatown looking for a christmas gift for his teenage son he comes across an odd little creature as adorable as a teddy bear called a mogwai he wants to buy it but the old man who runs the shop says its not for sale the old mans grandson however says they need the money and he brings it out to sell in the alley along with the mogwai comes three rules for taking care of him 1 he does not like bright lights 2 dont get him wet and 3 most important never ever feed him after midnightbr br of course all three rules are eventually broken and the results are scaly green gremlins that run riot all over town as i say the barroom scene is quite hilarious a large group of them are cornered in the movie theater where some more great visual jokes are done but stripe the leader of the gang gets into the department store across the streetbr br the cute little mogwai named gizmo eventually triumphs but how he does is the funniest movie youll see in many a year

Peep Show: Series 1-5 [DVD],"I LOVE Peep Show -- it's one of the all-time best and most insightful comedy series. But please be aware these are REGION 2 DVDs, meaning they won't work in North American (Region 1) DVD players. I bought this set brand new from the main product page, and my order was fulfilled by Amazon Prime -- I didn't buy from a one-off seller in the ""New and Used"" offerings section. I looked over the description page and pictures VERY CAREFULLY, several times, and ordered from the main product page.... jokes on me. If these DVD don't work on American DVD players, it should clearly state that. But it doesn't.<br /><br />More upsetting, the seller KNOWS people are ording these DVDs mistakenly and still doesn't state the region in the description, which would be very easy to do but would cut down on people accidentally buying this and presumably hurt their sales. The seller is ovbiously aware it's a problem, because the DVD set comes with a huge sticker on it which reads (verbatim, grammatical/punctuation mistakes and all):<br /><br />""PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU OPEN IT!<br />Before you'll open this item we remind you that this DVD you ordered has Region 2 code. It requires 'Region B/2' or 'Region FREE' player or PC with special software. This DVD will NOT work on a regular USA (Region A/1) player.<br /><br />""THIS IS THE EXACT DVD YOU'VE ORDERED..<br />If you made a mistake or didn't pay attention to the region information on this disk please DO NOT OPEN IT , request a return and choose option 'Bought by mistake'.""<br /><br />Bull hooey. That's information which should be IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION, not on the product itself after unwitting buyers have already paid for it. And I didn't ""buy this by mistake"", the region info wasn't in the product description. Frustrating. Obviously they think buyers should know the region info since they put it on the product, but to not put it in the description is hugely misleading. The region information simply isn't on the product page anywhere at the time of writing this review, I checked over and over again before buying, and again before writing this review. I'm returning the DVDs with it marked as an ""INACCURATE DESCRIPTION"", which is the truth. I hope others who fall for the seller's shennanigangs do the same.

Fifteen years later, they have been forced to adopt civilian identities and retreat to the suburbs where they live ""normal"" lives with their three kids, Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack.

Bird gives us a family of ""supers,"" a brood of five with special powers desperately trying to fit in with the 9-to-5 suburban lifestyle. Of course, in a more innocent world, Bob and Helen Parr were superheroes, Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl. But blasted lawsuits and public disapproval forced them and other supers to go incognito, making it even tougher for their school-age kids, the shy Violet and the aptly named Dash. When a stranger named Mirage (voiced by Elizabeth Pena) secretly recruits Bob for a potential mission, the old glory days spin in his head, even if his body is a bit too plump for his old super suit.', 'Bird has his cake and eats it, too.

Bird takes several jabs, including some juicy commentary on domestic life (""It\'s not graduation, he\'s moving from the fourth to fifth grade!"").', 'The animated Parrs look and act a bit like the actors portraying them, Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter. Samuel L. Jackson and Jason Lee also have a grand old time as, respectively, superhero Frozone and bad guy Syndrome.

The digital-to-digital transfer pops off the screen and the 5.1 Dolby sound will knock the socks off most systems. But like any superhero, it has an Achilles heel. This marks the first Pixar release that doesn't include both the widescreen and full-screen versions in the same DVD set, which was a great bargaining chip for those cinephiles who still want a full-frame presentation for other family members. With a 2.39:1 widescreen ratio (that's big black bars, folks, à la"", 'Dr. Zhivago', '), a few more viewers may decide to go with the full-frame presentation. Fortunately, Pixar reformats their full-frame presentation so the action remains in frame.', 'The Extras', 'The most-repeated segments will be the two animated shorts. Newly created for this DVD is the hilarious ""Jack-Jack Attack,"" filling the gap in the film during which the Parr baby is left with the talkative babysitter, Kari. ""Boundin\',"" which played in front of the film theatrically, was created by Pixar character designer Bud Luckey. This easygoing take on a dancing sheep gets better with multiple viewings (be sure to watch the featurette on the short).', 'Brad Bird still sounds like a bit of an outsider in his commentary track, recorded before the movie opened. Pixar captain John Lasseter brought him in to shake things up, to make sure the wildly successful studio would not get complacent. And while Bird is certainly likable, he does not exude Lasseter\'s teddy-bear persona. As one animator states, ""He\'s like strong coffee; I happen to like strong coffee."" Besides a resilient stance to be the best, Bird threw in an amazing number of challenges, most of which go unnoticed unless you delve into the 70 minutes of making-of features plus two commentary tracks (Bird with producer John Walker, the other from a dozen animators). We hear about the numerous sets, why you go to ""the Spaniards"" if you\'re dealing with animation physics, costume problems (there\'s a reason why previous Pixar films dealt with single- or uncostumed characters), and horror stories about all that animated hair. Bird\'s commentary throws out too many names of the animators even after he warns himself not to do so, but it\'s a lively enough time. The animator commentary is of greatest interest to those interested in the occupation.', 'There is a 30-minute segment on deleted scenes with temporary vocals and crude drawings, including a new opening (thankfully dropped). The ""secret files"" contain a ""lost"" animated short from the superheroes\' glory days. This fake cartoon (Frozone and Mr. Incredible are teamed with a pink bunny) wears thin, but play it with the commentary track by the two superheroes and it\'s another sharp comedy sketch. There are also NSA ""files"" on the other superheroes alluded to in the film with dossiers and curiously fun sound bits. ""Vowellet"" is the only footage about the well-known cast (there aren\'t even any obligatory shots of the cast recording their lines). Author/cast member Sarah Vowell (NPR\'s', 'This American Life', "") talks about her first foray into movie voice-overs--daughter Violet--and the unlikelihood of her being a superhero.

Bedtime for Bonzo [DVD],"Bedtime for Bonzo is one of Ronald Reagan's best- known films. Originally released in 1951, Regan was only 39 years old when this film was shot. Reagan is the main star of the show, but part of the credit for the film's success also belongs to Bonzo, the chimpanzee that Reagan takes under his wing; adopting him temporarily for a psychology experiment and attempting to teach him the difference between good and bad.<br /><br />Reagan's character in this film is a Psychology professor and the reason he raises Bonzo is to prove a point to the man who would later become his father in law. The man is Dean Tillinghast, and he is an associate professor at the same school. He discovers one day that Reagan's father was a convicted felon and he doesn't want the son of a criminal marrying his daughter because he is afraid the ""bad"" genes have been passed on and that Reagan will end up the same way. Reagan decides to conduct this experiment with Bonzo to prove a point that one's environment is the key to behavioral formation. He and actress Diane Lynn proceed to raise Bonzo and teach him right from wrong.<br /><br />The plot of this film is a little bit cheesy and some of it is very far- fetched. Even if the experiment succeeds, why would a fellow professor accept the behavior pattern of a chimp as proof that it also applies to humans? Of course, one has to keep in mind that this film is meant to be primarily a comedy, so the director likely made it a little bit unreal on purpose, just to make it funnier.<br /><br />Reagan, Herbert Heyes, and Walter Slezak are all pretty good in their respective roles. They seem at least believable in their personifications of the different characters. But the women in the movie seem a little bit too much like actresses. That is, they seem like people on a stage trying their best to act like normal people but not succeeding very well. They talk a little too fast and respond too quickly to questions, like they are being cued by a director.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is ok, but it isn't very memorable for its story or acting. The main thing that makes this movie memorable is Ronald Reagan himself. Watching the future president of the United States playing surrogate father to a chimp is funny and ironic, and it makes ""Bedtime for Bonzo"" worth a look.",4.7,178.0,"{'thumb': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41nHnkHmJCL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg', 'large': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41nHnkHmJCL.jpg', 'variant': 'MAIN', 'hi_res': None}","['The theory of evolution has never been so zanily tested.

Compulsion,"A fictionalized telling of the Leopold-Loeb murder case, in which two young men (apparently gay lovers, but that was barely hinted in 1959) murdered a boy just to have the experience to share. Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman portray Judd Steiner and Arthur Strauss. I'd have to refer back to the documentary on Leopold-Loeb to work out which is which. Strauss is the dominant one, the one most nearly evil in the classic sense of the term. He's the one who wants to run down a drunk in the road just because he feels like it. Judd turns the wheel away, but also tells Strauss he will do anything Strauss tells him to, that he wants Strauss to lead and order him.<br /><br />Some time is spent on the police work that went into discovering the identities of the killers, but it has the effect of showing that there is no effective defense on the facts, especially since both boys made confessions. OK, partly as accusing one another, but that matters little in such a crime.<br /><br />Things look pretty much like an inevitable hanging when the boys' wealthy parents hire Jonathan Wilk (Orson Welles) to defend them. [Clarance Darrow in the real case.] After the case was already opened and the jury empaneled, Wilk suddenly changes their pleas to guilty with mitigating circumstances. This means the punishment will be adjudicated by the judge alone, not a jury.",4.4,299.0,"{'thumb': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51JMYDV7VZL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg', 'large': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51JMYDV7VZL.jpg', 'variant': 'MAIN', 'hi_res': None}","['A lawyer defends two young thrill-killers, as in the 1920s Leopold-Loeb case.

Obsessive fans can debate the quirky logic of combining spaceships with direct parallels to frontier America (it\'s 500 years in the future, and embattled humankind has expanded into the galaxy, where undeveloped ""outer rim"" planets struggle with the equivalent of Old West accommodations), but Whedon and his gifted co-writers and directors make it work, at least well enough to fashion a credible context from the incongruous culture-clashing of past, present, and future technologies, along with a polyglot language (the result of two dominant superpowers) that combines English with an abundance of Chinese slang.
